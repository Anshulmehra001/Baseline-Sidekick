## üí° The Problem: The "Compatibility Tax"

Every web developer constantly asks: **"Is this feature safe to use yet?"** This leads to a frustrating cycle of context-switching between the IDE, MDN, and CanIUse.com, wasting valuable time and introducing project risk. This "compatibility tax" slows down innovation and makes adopting modern web standards a chore.

## üöÄ Our Solution: An Intelligent Co-pilot

Baseline Sidekick eliminates this tax. It's not just a linter that finds problems; it's an **AI-powered co-pilot that helps you solve them.** It makes writing modern, compatible code the easiest and most intuitive path, turning a tedious task into a satisfying experience.

| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ö° **Real-Time Analysis**         | Instantly flags non-Baseline CSS, JavaScript, and HTML features with clear diagnostics and rich hover info as you type.                         |
| ü§ñ **AI Modernization Assistant**  | Uses **Google Gemini** to generate intelligent fixes, from creating production-ready polyfills to refactoring entire legacy code blocks.         |
| üéÆ **Gamified "Baseline Score"** | Calculates a real-time compatibility score (A+ to F) for every file, gamifying the process of writing high-quality, modern code.                |
| üîç **Workspace Audit**           | Performs a comprehensive analysis of your entire project, generating a detailed report to help manage technical debt.                             |
| üåê **Multi-Language Support**    | Provides deep analysis for **CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML** using a robust, multi-parser engine.                                       |
| üõ†Ô∏è **Intelligent Build Integration** | The AI can suggest optimized configurations for your build tools like Babel or PostCSS to handle modern features automatically.                 |

## üöÄ Getting Started in 60 Seconds

### 1. Installation

You can install Baseline Sidekick directly from the VS Code Marketplace.

1.  Open the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
2.  Search for `Baseline Sidekick`.
3.  Click **Install**.

### 2. See it in Action

Once installed, open any CSS, JS, or HTML file. The extension will start working immediately.

**Try this CSS snippet:**

```css
.legacy-container {
  /* ‚ùå 'float' is a legacy property and will be flagged instantly */
  float: left;
  clear: both;
}

.modern-container {
  /* ‚úÖ 'display: grid' is Baseline and will have no warnings */
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;
} ```


Hover over float to see compatibility details, and click the lightbulb icon (üí°) to see the AI-powered Quick Fixes!


ü§ñ The Dual-AI Advantage


Baseline Sidekick uses a unique dual-engine approach for the best balance of speed and intelligence.
‚ö° Local Pattern Engine (For Speed)

A lightning-fast, offline engine that performs real-time analysis (<100ms) by matching code against a local database of over 30,000 web features. It provides instant diagnostics as you type.

### üß† Google Gemini API (For Intelligence)
When you need a solution, we call the Google Gemini API. Its advanced reasoning capabilities allow it to generate context-aware polyfills, refactor complex code, and provide deep, actionable insights that a simple pattern-matcher cannot.

This hybrid model ensures your editor remains responsive while giving you access to state-of-the-art AI power when you need it most.

## üîë Unlock Full AI Power (Optional)

The core analysis works out-of-the-box. To enable the generative AI features:

1.  Get a free Google Gemini API key from [Makersuite](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Open VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,`), search for `Baseline Sidekick`, and paste your API key into the `baselineSidekick.ai.geminiApiKey` field.
